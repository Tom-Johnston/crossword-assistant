# Crossword Assistant - Word Lists

The word lists here are UTF-8 encoded versions of the word lists from [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/). They've been converted from the default ISO8859-1 encoding to UTF-8 as Go works with strings in UTF-8 format. Information about the copyright of the various lists that SCOWL is based off can be found in [SCOWL Copyright information](scowl-copyright).
